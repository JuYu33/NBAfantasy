This project pulls data from my nba_stats_api.

The stats are of only the 2017-2018 NBA Regular season and Post Season games.

Select a date to find out what games were played on that day if any.

Then select a matchup to see the scores of that game.

Players data will be listed as box scores for a 9-cat head-head style format.

Please refer to nba_stats_api repo for more info on where/how the data is loaded.
